Project description:
~~~
The recently advances in biotechnologies have enabled the generation
of a large amount of gene expression data that are publicly available
on [ArrayExpress](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) or
[GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). But data in these public
repositories are usually neither well organized nor consistently
annotated making it difficult to fully unleash the power of these
data.

The goal of this project is to design a website which serves as a
basic framework for crowdsourcing of biodata curation. The website
should have the following features (more detailed requirements and
feedbacks will be provided as the project evolves).

1. An interested individual should be able to register on the website
as a data curator.

2. Training materials (we have something already but in a document
format) should be rendered to the curators in a user-friendly fashion
so that even people without much biological background will be able to
easily learn the necessary curation skills. Some examples of good user
interfaces can be found at <eternagame.org>.

3. The website should record the curation results of these registered
data curators which will be accessed both automatically (by comparing
the results among curators using, for example, weighted majority vote)
and manually (for the cases that are hard to be solved automatically).
Some ideas about this can be borrowed from
[reCAPTCHA](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5895/1465.full).
There should be a way to evaluate curators based on their past
performance. Thus, the results from curators who have good curation
history should be trusted more in deriving the correct results.

FYI. Here is our past curation outcome without such a website using
only a limited number of people. If there were such a website, it
would allow many people to contribute to this effort. Such crowdsource
approach would tremendously speed up the curation of large-scale
biological data. The high-quality curation results would allow more
efficient use of such data which will significantly impact biomedicine
research in this big data era.

main functions
~~~
- registration
- interactive training
- curation result recording
- User performance assessment: majority vote or manual assessment by admin
- scoring of the user by their performance (should be able to filter
out the users with low performance.
- administration
 - automatically assign the dataset to users (admin only need to
provide the term for searching in ArrayExpress or GEO. the data set
should be automatically extracted from those public websites.)
 - design curation questions
 - terminate the curation of a(a set of) dataset(s).
- user forum

admin: automatic assignment, question design, curation termination.
registration: supporting Gmail /facebook etc.
